**Bubble Sort**: 
- Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.
- It repeatedly goes through the array we want to sort, compares each pair of adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Selection Sort**: 
- Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
- This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

**Inserion Sort:**
- Assume the leftmost element belongs to the sorted part of the array, and all remaining elements are in the unsorted part;
- Choose the first element from the unsorted part and insert that element into the sorted list at its proper position;
- Repeat step 2, until all elements are sorted.
