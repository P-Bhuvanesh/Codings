# üßÆ DSA and Programming Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, problems, and solutions in various programming languages. It also features commonly asked interview questions, coding puzzles, and well-documented code examples. 

Whether you're a **beginner looking to learn DSA** or an **advanced user preparing for coding interviews**, this repo is designed to be your one-stop solution for mastering DSA and programming concepts.

## üìò About the Repository

This repository serves as a **DSA learning hub** with step-by-step explanations, code walkthroughs, and essential programming concepts. It aims to:
- Help users **understand and implement core DSA concepts**.
- Provide **solutions to commonly asked coding interview questions**.
- Include **hands-on coding exercises** to reinforce learning.
- Support multiple languages like **Java, Python, and C** [The logic are simpler so that it can be converted to other lang just syntax differs].

Key concepts covered include:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Heaps.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Backtracking, Divide-and-Conquer, and Greedy Algorithms.
- **Coding Challenges**: Problems inspired by LeetCode, HackerRank, and other platforms.
